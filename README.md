# MEVN-stack-example
Blog app redone with Vue.js frontend, using same Node/Express backend as the MERN stack example
This is the same basic Posts app that I wrote with React, but this version uses Vue.js for the front end portion. 

Basic fully CRUD enabled app using the MEVN stack:

    MongoDB Atlas
    Mongoose ODM for MongoDB modeling
    Node.js JavaScript runtime
    Express web framework for Node.js
    Vue.js for the front end

Other packages I've used with this:

    axios and the fetch API
    bootstrap 4
    Vuex for state management
    Vue-router
And by default, I know a little bit of webpack now also.
